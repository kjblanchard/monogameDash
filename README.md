# Supergoon Dash - Monogame

Wanted to start back on 2d gamedev, so to update my engine code, going to make a geometry dash clone with monogame

Tiled And FMOD build into the desktop project, and that is copied over (does not use the Monogame Content pipeline)
M1 support in monogame in 3.8 is not ready, supposed to be released with monogame 3.9 (for development and building)

SupergoonEngine - Classes that could possibly be reused between Monogame developed games, this is a shared project (not really supported anymore in C#) so I've installed the libraries in Cross platform, this should be moved in the future.
SupergoonDashCrossPlatform - Most of the game logic, this can be used as a resource for a specific Platform
SupergoonDashDesktop - Desktop build, can run in Windows, MacOS(intel) and Linux
